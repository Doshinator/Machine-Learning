\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the analysis and evaluation on data sets using machine learning techniques. Our method in this assignment consist of working with three data sets and implement ML algorithms on them to understand more about the field of machine learning and its applications in the real world. The three three data sets worked on in this project was  Boston housing, breast cancer, and Forest Covertype.

\section{Introduction}
The goal of this final project is to show that we have learned something in the class. It is an opportunity for us to explore ideas that we have see in the lectures and assignments and extend them. This project is a first steps towards research in machine learning or its applications. We will analyze problems, design a machine learning solution, implement ML algorithms, and evaluate them on three data sets (one for classification and one for regression from “Small Data Sets” and one data set – either classification or regression – from “Large Data Sets”).
